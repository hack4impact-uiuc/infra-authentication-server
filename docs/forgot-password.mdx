# Forgot Password

This is a POST request endpoint that allows for email reset of a password for a user in the database.

In order to get email set up, please follow the linked instructions.

To issue a password reset email, you will send a POST request to `/forgotPassword/` with the following in the body:

```json
{
    email: test@example.com,
    security_answer: abc
}
``` 

Note that a JWT is not needed for this because the user does not need to have any form of authentication.



## Get Security Question

Get the security question stored with user - this is required if the field `securityQuestion` is set to true in the `config.yaml` file. 

**URL** : `/getSecurityQuestion?email=test@example.com`

**Method** : `GET`

**Auth required** : NO

**Permissions required** : None

### Response

**Code** : `200 OK` if the user could be successfully found.

**Code** : `500` if there was an internal server error and the security question couldn't be retrieved, or the `securityQuestion` is not configured. 

**Code** : `400` if the email requested did not exist in the database. 

**Content examples**

The API will return the following if the password was successfully reset:

```json
{
    "status": 200,
    "question": "What street did you grow up on?"
}
```


## Reset Password

### Request 

The following is an example request to the endpoint:

```json

}
``` 

Where `answer` is the answer to the security question previously fetched with `getSecurityQuestion`.

### Response

**Code** : `200 OK` if all the fields match up and the password reset token could be issued successfully.

**Code** : `500` if there was a server issue (mail server, DB connection, etc.)

**Code** : `400` if there was an issue with the email being invalid.

**Content examples**

If the email could successfully be sent, the API will return:

```json
{
    "status": 200,
    "message": "Sent password reset PIN to user if they exist in the database."
}
```

    pin: 75834921,
    password: verysecurepassword

}
``` 


### Response

**Code** : `200 OK` if the user had an updated password.

**Code** : `500` if there was an internal server error and the password could not be updated.

}
```


# Workflow 

1. User navigates to some "forgot password" link on the frontend.

2. User enters email in the provided field.

3. Client makes a GET request to `/getSecurityQuestion?email=test@example.com`, and, if user exists, gets a securtiy question back.

4. User enters security question answer. 

5. Makes a post request to the API which goes to the auth server 
    * form encoded body with email and security question answer
    * doesn't need a JWT, isn't authenticated


6. Seaches for the user in the database, if it exists and the security question matches, it generates a pin and current database

7. In the user model sets the date field called "expiration" to that current date + 24 hours.

8. Sets the pin to the 7 digit code.

9. Using Nodemailer, it sends an email to the user if the user exists.

9. Will return a response based on whether the email was successfully sent to the user.

10. User enters PIN in a field in the client to reset password.

11. Client sends request to `/resetPassword` with the updated password, email, and PIN.

12. If all is successful, expiration is invalidated and password is changed. If not (email doesn't match, PIN is expired, etc.) then an error message will be returned to the client.
User gets logged in with the returned JWT.

***Security Question? Make it an optional feature before the pin***

* Set a default security question in the database (if the user doesnt exist)
* Field with every user for specific questions
* Dev team can choose questions, auth server handles everything. 
* Config file can turn off this functionality
