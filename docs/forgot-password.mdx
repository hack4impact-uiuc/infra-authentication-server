# Forgot Password

This is a POST request endpoint that allows for email reset of a password for a user in the database.

In order to get email set up, please follow the linked instructions.

To issue a password reset email, you will send a POST request to `/forgot/` with the following in the body:

```json
{
    email: test@example.com
}
``` 

Note that a JWT is not needed for this because the user does not need to have any form of authentication.

The auth server will respond with success *if the email was able to be sent without error*. It's important to note here that the endpoint will still return SUCCESS even if the user does not exist in the database. It will only error-out if there was an issue with the email server itself. This is to prevent a brute-force attack on emails that exist in our database.
