# Forgot Password

This is a POST request endpoint that allows for email reset of a password for a user in the database.

In order to get email set up, please follow the linked instructions.

To issue a password reset email, you will send a POST request to `/forgot/` with the following in the body:

```json
{
    email: test@example.com
}
``` 

Note that a JWT is not needed for this because the user does not need to have any form of authentication.

The auth server will respond with success *if the email was able to be sent without error*. It's important to note here that the endpoint will still return SUCCESS even if the user does not exist in the database. It will only error-out if there was an issue with the email server itself. This is to prevent a brute-force attack on emails that exist in our database. 

## Reset Password

Get the details of the currently Authenticated User along with basic
subscription information.

**URL** : `/forgot_password/`

**Method** : `POST`

**Auth required** : NO

### Request 

The following is an example request to the endpoint:

```json
{
    email: test@example.com
}
``` 


### Response

**Code** : `200 OK` if the response was sent correctly.

**Code** : `500` if there was a server issue (mail server, DB connection, etc.)

**Code** : `400` if there was an issue with the email being invalid.

**Content examples**

If the email could successfully be sent, the API will return:

```json
{
    "status": 200,
    "message": "Sent password reset PIN to user if they exist in the database."
}
```

}
``` 


### Response

**Code** : `200 OK` if the user had an updated password.

**Code** : `500` if there was an internal server error and the password could not be updated.

**Code** : `400` if there was an issue with the PIN being expired or a mismatch in email/PIN.

# Workflow 

1. Clicks on /forgot password

2. Makes a post request 
    * form encoded body with email
    * doesn't need a jwt, isn't authenticated

3. Goes to the API

4. Redirects to Auth server

5. Seaches for the user in the database, if it exists it generates a pin and current database

6. In the user model sets the date field called "expiration" to that current date + 24 hours

7. Sets the pin to the 7 digit code

8. Using nodemailer it sends an email to the user if the user exists 
    Subject forgot passord, gives them the pin

9. Always send a 200 sent email, dont wanna reveal is user is not in the database

10. Will catch errors in the node mailer, send back an error only if email is not sent or user doesnt exist 



1. Need another endpoint to validate an update in password
    The body of the request should contain pin and new password



***Security Question? Make it an optional feature before the pin***

* Set a default security question in the database (if the user doesnt exist)
* Field with every user for specific questions
* Dev team can choose questions, auth server handles everything. 
* Config file can turn off this functionality



1. Rewrite Workflow

2. Give every endpoint at the top with sample
