# Login and Logout


## Endpoints 

| Endpoint | /login [POST] |
| ------ | ----------- |
| body   | email, hashed password |
| response | success or error message, jwt token if the account is authenticated |



## Login Workflow

### Step 1: Filling out the form on the client side

This will include fields for 
* email
* password
* an option to sign up using their google accounts

We will provide an example of the login pages, but let the team customize it towards their needs and integrate it in. 

### Step 2: Sends the login request to the API, redirected by the API to the authentication server. 

### Step 3: Authentication Server Validation

* password matches
* email is verified

### Step 4: Authentication Server Response
If valid, the authentication server will encrypt a jwt token that contains the user id and permision level, and send it back to the API.

### Step 5: API Response
If valid, the API will respond to the client with a success message and the jwt token sent from the Authentication Server. This token is storred in cookies and sent with every request. 


## Logout Workflow

Step 1: Delete the jwt token from cookies
