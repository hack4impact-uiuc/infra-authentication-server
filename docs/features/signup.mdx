## Signing Up Workflow

### Step 1: Filling out the form on the client side

This will include fields for 
* email
* password 
* security question (optional)
* answer to the security question (optional)
* token for signing in with their google accounts (optional)
* and any other optional fields that is required by the team

We will provide an example of the signup pages, but let the team customize it towards their needs and integrate it in. 

### Step 2: Sends the signup request to the API, redirected by the API to the authentication server, and signing it with some key that the user know. 

### Step 3: Authentication Server Validation

* Has valid permission levels
* email is valid -- follows our regex pattern, isn't already in our database
* strong password

If validated, it will add a new entry to the database with an autogenerated unique user id, email, password, permission level, security question, answer to the security question, time the account was created, and a boolean variable that determines if an account has been verified

It also sends an email to the person signing up, and once they click it will verify their email address. If the account isn't verified after 24 hours, the credentials will no longer work. 

### Step 4: Authentication Server Response
If valid, the authentication server will encrypt a jwt token that contains the user id and permision level, and send it back to the API.

### Step 5: API Response
If valid, the API will decrypt the token, get the user id, and make an account with any other revelant information. 
The API will make a new user account with that user id, and any other information from signup that the dev team decided to add. 

It will respond to the clinet with a success message and the jwt token sent from the Authentication Server. This token is storred in cookies and sent with every request.
