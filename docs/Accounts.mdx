# Accounts
Here is everything about
1. creating an account,
2. logging in, and
3. logging out

## 1. Creating an account
On the frontend, the client would see an empty form for them to input the required
and preferred information to create an account with our dev team client's application. 
This will include fields to put in an email, username, password (twice for good measure), 
optional security questions (which can be customized by the dev team client), and an 
optional phone number. Clients also have the option to sign into the application with 
their Google accounts. 

Dev team clients will be able to customize this to indicate what fields they want for their 
users.

### /register [POST]
This endpoint takes in the values that a user puts into the frontend. in the endpoint 
above, and sends it to our auth server. The server will make sure that the values passed in are 
valid and eligible to make a new user.


## 2. Logging in
The user client would be shown a simple form to input their login information. This i nformation 
is then passed into our server to confirm that 1. the user exists and 2. the credentials match.

## 3. Logging out
When the user logs out, the token will be deleted from the cookies.

## Endpoint Examples:









## /register [POST]
This endpoint takes in the values that a user has put into the default form in the endpoint above, and sends it to our auth server. The server will make sure that the values passed in are valid and eligible to make a new user.

## /login [GET]
This endpoint displays the default login form for users to interact with. The frontend should validate the values put into the form to see if they are syntactically eligble to be login credentials.

## /login [POST]???
This endpoint is fired when the "log in" button is clicked in the previous endpoint.  The server takes in the input values and checks its database to see if this is a real user.

## /logout [GET]???
This endpoint will log the user out of the application, (cookies blah blah blah), and redirect to the home page, where no user credentials are required???
