# Accounts
Here is everything about
1. creating an account,
2. logging in, and
3. logging out

## 1. Creating an account
On the frontend, the client would see an empty form for them to input the required
and preferred information to create an account with our dev team client's application. 
This will include fields to put in an email, username, password (twice for good measure), 
optional security questions (which can be customized by the dev team client), and an 
optional phone number. Clients also have the option to sign into the application with 
their Google accounts. 

There is a default form template for our dev team clients to use. They can choose to customize 
the module or create their own to integrate with our authentication model.

### /register [POST]
This sends the email, password, optional security questions, optional phone numbers, 
google auth, and permission level to our server. The permission level(s) will be specified 
by the dev team in a config file or as a dropdown onthe default client side.

### Validation
For signing up, we will validate a few things:
* sign up has base permission levels
* email is valid -- follows our regex pattern, isn't already in our database
* email is valid pt 2 -- check that the link sent to their email has been clicked to set the account to validated in the database
* strong password

## 2. Logging in
For user clients, there will be a simple form to take in email and password or google auth 
to sign them in.

### /login [POST]
This sends the email and password to our server. From there, the password will be hashed on both 
the frontend and backend for extra security. Our server will check if the user is a valid, existing user with
the correct password, and then send permission level, userid, and token to the dev team client's API.

## 3. Logging out
When the user logs out, the token will be deleted from the cookies.
