# Google OAuth

Confused? Don't worry, me too.

## Some nice links:
More will be added over time :)

* [Flask API](https://www.flaskapi.org/#example)
* [OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)

## Development:
* Google OAuth stuff. Flask to handle endpoints.
* Endpoint to talk to Google server. Special endpoints to accomodate for lack of password in server.

## Diagrams:
### Backend
* Client sends a login request to Google.
* Google authenticates everything, sends a token back. Client stores this token as cookies.
* Auth server stores some flag. Don't need to keep password; Google takes care of this.
* The token is then passed around to the API/auth server to check permissions.
* Token is passed back to Google auth to make sure nothing fishy is going on. They can also be cycled.

### Frontend
"Sign In With Google" button. Google can handle the rest.

You know the great thing about buttons? They can be anywhere you want them to!

## Usage:
### Devs
* Enable whether or not to use this feature and have it appear on frontend. 
Hopefully won't have to do much else with their API.

Michael this is beautiful

Questions to answer
* Do we need to store the email when sending the request to the auth server? 
* what do the responses look like?
