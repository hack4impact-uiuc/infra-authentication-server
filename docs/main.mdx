# Authentication Server

We want to build a open sourced authentication system with easy integration and well-thought out solutions for allowing users to securely handle signing up for an account, logging in, changing passwords, and promoting people to different levels of access. This will allow our teams to add this authentication system to their infrastructure at any point in time in a time.

The authentication server comes with end points all ready build for all authentictaion workflows.
